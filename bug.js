In Next.js, an uncommon error arises when using `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` with dynamic routes and encountering an edge case where the data fetching process throws an error but the error isn't properly handled, resulting in a blank or broken page.  This often occurs when the data fetching function unexpectedly returns an error, but the error handling within the `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` function is inadequate or missing. For example, a network error, a database error during a query, or an unexpected response format from an API can cause such a problem.
